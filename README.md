This project creates a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for generating and solving mazes using **Tkinter** in Python.

## 📌 Features
- **Maze Generation** – Uses an algorithm to generate a random maze.
- **Maze Solving** – Implements a pathfinding algorithm to find the solution.
- **Graphical Interface** – Built with **Tkinter** for an interactive experience.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3** installed. Check with:
```sh
python3 --version
```
If you encounter this error:
```sh
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_tkinter'
```
You need to install Tkinter:
```sh
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```
Verify Tkinter is installed correctly:  
```sh
python3 -m tkinter
```
You should see a little window pop up with some buttons inside. If you do, it's working. You can close that window.  

Run the application:
```sh
./main.sh
```
